Date: Jan 31

Transcript:
 
Me: This is not a meeting, just a monologue. Where I am capturing some thoughts. On a trip that I am organizing. This trip is to celebrate my wife Laura's fortieth birthday. We will be celebrating with four other couples. And I need to put together a website. Explaining to the other couples what's going on. So what is going on is that I will be renting a property near Zion National Park. I provided a link to that property. And I'd like for you to review the property so you understand its aesthetics and what it offers. The other people traveling with us are all excited to go on hikes and eat good food and hang out together. This will be five couples. Most of us are in our forties. We will not have kids. And this will be a probably five day stay in October during Austin Classical School's fall break I plan to make this website, which will just be a landing page. And share it with the four other couples. And in sharing the website, that's where they will each learn that they've been invited to this trip. And that I will be paying for the lodging. All they need to do is get there. And this is in celebration of my wife, Laura's, fortieth birthday. I want to excite them about the great things that we can do in and around Zion National Park. Such as the hikes maybe horseback riding or renting side by sides or UTVs. As well as just enjoying lodging together cooking some good food, and finding good places to eat. And sitting by the fire. I would like to use AMP code to create this one page website that I can share to my friends. And my hope is that through the aesthetics and clean design and through everything I've just explained. It generates interest and excitement so that my friends will commit to going on this trip. Since we are all a little bit more outdoorsy, I'd like for the style of the site to not only be clean, but to also look like something from an REI catalog or from another popular camping or outdoorsy website? If needed, I can provide photos And you can just provide photo placeholders. Otherwise, you can go ahead and provide the photos on your own.
